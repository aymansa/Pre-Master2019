  - Was a revision 
  
-  class work is on  :
  
      -- search  for a paper on title on parallel computing 
  -
      -- your are required to provide a report about it (explain it ,  limitation of the paper m , try to implement it )
 
  - Notes from Lec 
 
      -- Network topologies and degree of each one (Degree : number of in and out lines from the node )
     
               1. Line or Bus  Topo. , 			 Degree :  1 or 2
 
               2. Ring Topo            			 Degree : 2 
     
               3. Star Topo. ,          		                   Degree :  1 or n-1
     
               4. Mesh Topology (2D).  		 Degree :  2 or 3 or 4.  
            
   5. Torus (Mesh with rounded edges)              Degree : 4 
     
               6. Cube                                                             Degree : 3
  
               7. Symmetric tree                                             Degree : 1,2,3
 
      -- Routing    : Choosing the best route from source to destination. 
 
      -- Switching  :
   
            --- Switching   Techniques :
    ***Task next time to prepare a short summary on the above Switching techniques ***
                   1) Store and forward  
                  2)virtual cut through. 
                  3) circuit switching 
                  4) wormhole switching (packet switching)
      

       
-- Parallel Computing systems Types :
  
            --- shared memory system :  all nodes share one address space 
     
            --- distributed memory system : every node has it's local  memory   
     
            --- distributed shared memory : hybrid
    
  -
- static and dynamic interconnection 
 
      -- communication mechanisms 
  
            - 1 to one 
  
            - many source to many destinations   -> multiply one to one
 
            - Broadcast :  from single node to all others ,  the same message 
   
            - multi cast : from single node to some nodes not the all 
    
            -  scatter :  from one node to all others but different messages 
   
            - many to one 
      
            - gathering :  many to one , different messages 
      
            - map.      :  many to one ,  the same message 
   
            - many to many  : all broad cast or all scatter
